# python-challenge

This is the week 3 homework regarding Python. 

There are two folders, each of which contain separate projects I have completed, PyBank and Pypoll. In each of PyBank and Pypoll, there is a Resources folder which contains the CSV of the information I needed to use for the project. 

There is also an Analysis folder, which contains the txt file I created from the code I wrote which details the results of the analysis. 

Finally there is the main Python script, which is the code I wrote.
